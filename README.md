# digneolatin â€“ Digital Tools and Neo-Latin texts

## Why **digital** Neo-Latin studies?

Huge production of Neo-Latin texts throughout the early modern period. Well into the 18th century Latin was the single most used language in Europe, outnumbering 
texts in English, French, German and Italian.

Still, Neo-Latin Studies as a discipline is relatively small. Increasingly few scholars read Latin outside the traditional Classics departments (with their focus on ancient Latin). Thus Neo-Latin texts (and their impact on early modern culture) are underrepresented.

Digital methods are indispensable for us to cope with the quantities of texts that have come upon us.
